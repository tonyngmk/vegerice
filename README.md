For eaters by eaters, to hunt for the best food deals (community-driven).

## Why is this required? Don't we have Kiasu Foodies TG group, food reviews by bloggers, or even Google Maps, etc.?

Since the advent of e-commerce, comparing products has been easy through community-sourced 5-point review systems.

However, what about brick and mortar food stalls? It is clear that not all eating establishments are hopping onto the food delivery hype-train any time soon, and hence comparing for the "Best Caifan in the East" is only a shouting match between the minority few younger and slightly tech-savvy owners who makes traditional Facebook pages to promote their stalls.

I don't know about you, but personally I would love to share a note of joy once I've had a  good plate of Chicken Rice or Caifan which exceeded my expectations, and also gripes of a particular food / stall that I would personally not revisit.

Google Map seems to be the closest thing that can achieve this. But it is not (and maybe it should not be) particularly "food-focused". For instance, I am craving for the best-value dim-sum instead of it being simply the cheapest. This could be achieved with filtering tag='dimsum' sort by highest review, but Google Maps should not support this as it is not "Google Food" lol. 

## Plans

Currently, I have many ideas about this app but  my ideas are bottlenecked by my ability to code it out.

I intend to create a MVP with barebones features and use / improve it personally. 

My ultimate hope for this app is that this can turn to become some social good for Singaporeans and this app eventually break-evens after scaling with its server / API costs supported through light-forms of advertisements or monetisation strategy.

As mentioned, there are still so many things to build if I can. React native development would definitely be next in mind, deploying to Android and iOS devices (Apple Developer Plan to deploy the app is alr $99/year lol) as no one person would like to use a browser while on a phone. Also, many other ideas such as finding "healthy meals", creating "wallet feature" for a two-pronged contributing of price data and also tracking of one's personal expenses, social media feature, PoS and ordering through app (does not have to be delivery, can be just dine-in / takeaway) support for food owners, etc.

## Checklist

- [ ] Shop category should be synonymous with "cuisine", is there a way to automatically tag this (rule-based / AI)? 
- [ ] Add realistic market, shops, shop_item, data
- [ ] Create "Market" / "Shop"  page. This should use static-site generation (SSG). 
- [ ] Create FE UI for creating new "Market" / "Shop", should be easy and not overwhelming (SSG).
- [ ] Think about data cleaning and backend in tehfuture. Likely not as easy, as inputing data freely creates a lot of dirty data.
    - Thinking of not automatically cleaning this. Changing user's input will create suspicion that the app is influenced and not truly "community-driven".
    - Users will self-correct and find the correct "stall" like finding an official instagram account as compared to fakes on own accords as well.
